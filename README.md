## Why you chose.
### Challenge 1
I used the while statement because the proccess will execute as long as the number was not 1 and was positive. I know how to work while loops in a way that it worked best for me in that circumstance.
### Challenge 2
Using the for loop and range allows you to divide the selected number and numbers from 2 to one less of that number. Letting you dictate whether the number is prime or not. 
### Challenge 3
I have a better understanding of while loops. I am able to arrange it in a way that sets the number to less than or equal to 10. 10 is the limit.
## How it works
### Challenge 1
The code takes an input that then goes to several steps dividing even numbers by two and multiplying 3 and adding one to odds until the sequence reaches 1 and states the steps it took to get there. 
### Challenge 2
Takes a positive integer then tests to see if it is divisible by a number in the range of 2 to input number minus one. It then prints whether the number is prime or not and what does divide into it if it isn't prime.
### Challenge 3
The last challenge doesn't take an input. It simply displays a multiplication. The first column displays number 1 - 10. The rest show the result of multiplying the top row of numbers, 1 - 10, by the numbers in the first column.
## AI assistance
I wasn't paying attention and finished Challenge 2 without using a loop. So, I went over and tried to recreate my if statements into loops. It was rather confusing at the time and I got stuck. Google Gemini suggested using a variable of "is_prime" set to True to make the entire program easier to manipulate whether it's true or false.
